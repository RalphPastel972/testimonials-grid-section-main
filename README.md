- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Self-assessment

#### What I learnt

I had to get deeper into grid to understand it better. I feel I still have so much to learn.

I used background-image for the very first time.

I also used var for fonts for the 1st time.

I am still really bad to estimate how long I need to do a challenge.

#### What I am proud of

Just my consistency.

#### What I would do differently

I would spend more time to plan the best layout and the best approach for a challenge.

#### Challenges

I am still way to slow.

#### Help needed

Nothing specific. But I am open to any critics that will make me improve.

#### Continued development

I will do again a challenge or two and then I will learn JS.
